    <h1>Baked Ziti Recipe</h1>

    <img src="food-pictures/ziti.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Simply the best baked ziti recipe. I am half Italian,
    was raised eating the finest Italian-American cuisine, 
    and have filmed almost 2,000 recipe videos, so when you 
    consider all of those facts, it seems incredible that I 
    have never posted a video for baked ziti. Hopefully I make 
    up for that long wait by posting what I think is the best version
    of it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. 
            Remove and discard casings.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat. Add 
            sausages and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking 
            up with a spatula, until sausage begins to brown, and onion turns 
            translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add oregano, thyme, and rosemary and
            cook for 1 minute more. Pour in marinara sauce. Pour 1 cup water 
            into each jar to rinse out remaining sauce;
            add to the saucepan. Stir together and bring sauce to a simmer.
        </li>

        <li>
            Reduce the heat to medium-low, and let simmer, stirring 
            occasionally, for 1 hour. Taste for seasoning and adjust 
            if needed. Turn off heat and reserve until needed. Before
            using, skim any excess fat that rises to the surface.
        </li>

        <li>
            While sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted 
            water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, 
            for 1 or 2 minutes less than the directions on the package 
            call for, about 8 minutes. Drain well and transfer into a 
            large mixing bowl.
        </li>

    </ol>
