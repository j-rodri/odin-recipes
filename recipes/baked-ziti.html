    <h1>Baked Ziti Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Simply the best baked ziti recipe. I am half Italian,
    was raised eating the finest Italian-American cuisine, 
    and have filmed almost 2,000 recipe videos, so when you 
    consider all of those facts, it seems incredible that I 
    have never posted a video for baked ziti. Hopefully I make 
    up for that long wait by posting what I think is the best version
    of it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
    </ul>
