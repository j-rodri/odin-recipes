    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Snowballs, a.k.a. Russian tea cakes or Mexican wedding cookies, 
        are melt-in-your-mouth cookies made with staple ingredients: 
        butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, flour, finely chopped 
        nuts, and salt. The round cookies are rolled in powdered sugar, 
        so they sort of resemble snowballs. The festive treat is often 
        served during the holiday season.
